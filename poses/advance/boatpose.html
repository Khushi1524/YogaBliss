HOW TO DO BOAT POSE 

1. Start in a seated position with your legs together and your knees bent. Place your hands behind you and lift up onto your fingertips. Lift your chest up while drawing in your ribs and navel.
2. Lean back just enough to come to the very back of your sit bones and lift your legs up. Point your toes, squeeze your inner thighs together, and engage your core.
3.For an extra challenge, send your arms forward in line with your legs. For even more of a challenge, straighten your legs and lift your chest and your gaze up.
