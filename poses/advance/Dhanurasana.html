The archer-inspired Bow Pose will leave you feeling strong in the body and open in the heart. Itâ€™s the perfect remedy to a day of sitting hunched over at your desk as it deeply stretches your back muscles. Classified as an intermediate yoga pose, it does require some flexibility as well as control to slowly release it. If you need to modify Bow Pose, you can use yoga straps around your ankles to bring your legs and arms closer together.
