Crow Pose is one of the first arm balances that new yoga students practice. In addition to being a fun foundational challenge, Crow Pose requires a good sense of control and recognition of your center of gravity, as well as arm strength to support you. 

To be successful at doing Crow Pose, itâ€™s helpful to create a strong foundation by keeping your hands shoulder-width apart, rounding your back, and holding your gaze forward to keep you steady.
