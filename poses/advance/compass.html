As with most yoga poses, compass pose is typically incorporated into a series of poses, or a flow. While there's not a specific flow unique to compass pose, it's important that the selection of poses preceding compass helps warm you up and prepare your body for the extreme hamstring stretch.


It's always a good idea to get warm with a series of sun salutations, then incorporate hamstring, hip, and shoulder-openers, including poses like standing crescent, lizard lunge, wide-legged standing forward folds, fire log pose, and gate pose. Here is what you need to know about compass pose.

steps

Sit in a comfortable, cross-legged position.
Breathe in and bend your right knee, hugging it into your chest. You may leave your left leg bent or straighten it in front of you.
Lift your right leg with your left hand. Thread your right arm underneath your right knee, bringing the right fingertips to the floor outside of your right hip.
Breathe slowly and steadily as you focus on sitting tall, lengthening your spine and staying upright as you move into this position.
Use your left hand to position your right knee as high up on the right arm as possible. The goal is to get the right knee to align behind the right shoulder with your right leg straight.
Bring your left hand to the outside edge of your right foot.
Begin to straighten your right leg as you stretch your left arm back behind your head.
Look up toward your left arm, keeping your spine upright.
Take three to five deep breaths here as you hold the pose.
Release the pose carefully, exhaling as you guide your right leg back down slowly with your left hand before repeating to the other side.
