Need to reset your pasture posture ? Cow Face Pose (Gomukhasana) provides some much-needed stretch throughout your body, loosening up your back, hips, chest, and shoulders. Try it after prepping with a dramatic hip-opener like Pigeon or as a deepening pose after Folded Butterfly. Afterwards, relax into a feel-good supine twist like Twisted Roots or counter with an opening backbend like Bridge.
