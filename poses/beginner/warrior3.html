Fiercely find your balance. Warrior III is the third in a series of three Warriro poses, but doesn’t always get invited to the party. It’s not even part of Dancing Warrior! Warriors I and II build a sturdy foundation on two legs, but Warrior III has an entirely different relationship with the ground: You’re just as focused and determined, but standing on one leg.

By adding a flat-backed forward bend into the mix, Warrior III doesn’t just ask you to balance, but recenter. Just like you’re coming to terms with a fresh stance (and even doing some balancing) in the previous Warriors, it’s an opportunity to ask yourself what you need to feel grounded. It’s just on hard mode.

Explore this pose to figure out how it works best for you. Do you need to bring a wall into it? Where do your arms feel like they need to be? It’s a beautiful, meditative opportunity to check in with your body, because you’re probably not thinking about much else when you’re recalibrating.


HOW TO DO WARRIOR III POSE
Come to a standing position with your feet together.

Bring your hands to your heart center and look out in front of you to find a focal point. Begin to fold your torso forward as you reach one leg back behind you.

Bring your torso and lifted foot into one straight line.

Point the toes of the lifted-leg foot, and look down to find balance. Root down through all four corners of your standing leg foot.

Lift your kneecap to engage your quadricep, and squeeze your inner thighs together to find mula bandha.

Stay here, or reach your arms back behind you.

For more of a challenge, reach your arms forward and draw your ribs in.
