Spread those gorgeous wings! Bird of Paradise (Svarga Dvidasana) is an intermediate one-leg balance that can add a fun challenge to your Warrior series — or anywhere else in your flow. This pose challenges your flexibility, balance, and focus alike, and can be a great hip opener if you spend a lot of time sitting.
Bird of Paradise works well as a peak pose, especially when you’ve been building up over a few rounds. Think of it like a reverse Half Moon, and try popping up after a Bound Extended Side Angle Pose or Bound Warrior.
