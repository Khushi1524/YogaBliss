Half Moon Pose, or Ardha Chandrasana, is a fun, expansive standing balance. Often sequenced after Triangle or Extended Side Angle pose, Half Moon looks a little bit like pausing mid-cartwheel, with your arms and legs outstretched and only one side of your body making contact with the floor. This pose leaves your hips and heart open, countering the binding and compression that often comes before it.

Like any balancing pose, Half Moon can be challenging at first — but some pretty simple modifications can provide some significant support. It’s also scalable into more advanced postures, making it a versatile pose for yogis of most levels. Try using it to add a little extra spice to your Dancing Warrior!
