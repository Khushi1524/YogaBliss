Dolphin Pose is a basic and easy yoga asana if you want to open up your shoulders and tone the biceps.
This Asana is very similar to Downward-Facing Dog Pose (Adho Mukha Svanasana). The only difference is, we have to place the forearms forward supporting body weight instead of the wrist. So, if you are having wrist pain, you can perform this asana in place of Downward Dog.

It is very beneficial for the body as it aids in the flexibility and strength of the entire body. As Dolphin Pose gives more than a half benefits of Headstand or Shirshasana, it is an extremely good option for those who can not perform Headstand.

steps
Come onto your hands and knees (all fours). Place your forearms on the floor, your elbows directly under your shoulders. You can either place the palms of your hands down with your forearms parallel with each other or interlace your fingers, tucking the bottom little finger in. 
As you exhale, curl your toes under. Engage your lower belly and lift your knees away from the floor
Lift your sitting bones up and lengthen the tailbone as you straighten your legs and lower the heels towards the floor – they do not need to touch the floor.
Engage your thigh muscles and keep the lower belly drawn in, press the forearms actively into the floor. 
Firm your shoulder blades down onto your back while maintaining space between them. Lengthen your spine. Hold your head between your arms, off the floor. 
Stay for 5 to 20 breaths. 
To come out of the pose, allow your knees to come back onto the floor as you exhale and rest in Child’s Pose.
