Eagle Pose (Garudasana) is a fun and challenging balance pose that combines stretching, strengthening, and compression. Like most balancing poses, it can also improve focus â€” especially because it involves holding a difficult posture at the same time. Mastering this pose can help you to improve on advanced inverted poses like handstands and headstands. Many modified poses also borrow from Eagle, and the arm and leg shapes can be fun add-ons and challenges to poses like Side Plank or Crescent Lunge.
HOW TO DO EAGLE POSE

1.
Come into a standing position. Bring your right knee knee over your left knee and bend your leg. If flexibility allows, wrap the foot of your top leg behind the calf of your standing leg.


2.
Square your hips, keep your chest lifted, and keep your pelvis in neutral alignment.


3.
Wrap your right arm underneath your left arm and cross at the elbows.


4.
Bring your palms together and raise your elbows to shoulder height. Draw your forearms forward.


5.
Sink your tailbone down to a comfortable height, and bring your gaze forward or slightly up.
