Learning how to do Wheel Pose can be a long journey, but the process is very rewarding. In Wheel Pose, also known as Upward Facing Bow Pose, or traditionally as Urdhva Dhanurasana, youâ€™ll engage your entire body, open your chest, hips, and shoulders, and feel a deep, energizing stretch. While it requires a solid foundation of strength, energy, and flexibility, it can lead to a very freeing expression of your practice.

This beautiful backbend is definitely one to work up to. Before you attempt Wheel Pose, make sure you warm up your spine with backbends like Cobra, Bridge, and the other prep poses listed below. Practice makes progress, but if you find this backbend to be uncomfortable, consider staying with Bridge Pose and Bow Pose until your arms and shoulders feel ready to move to Wheel. And, when you feel solid in Wheel Pose, try exploring one of the many fun Wheel Pose variations!
