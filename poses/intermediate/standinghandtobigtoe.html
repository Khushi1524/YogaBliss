Utthita Hasta Padangusthasana (Extended Hand-to-Big-Toe Pose) is a balancing posture in which you raise one leg at hip level and hold onto its big toe with your hand. It’s a pose that can make you feel powerful—and build on your strength and flexibility, particularly in the back of your legs and your ankles.
If you have tight hamstrings and can’t straighten your leg while keeping your spine straight, use a strap, practice with a bent lifted knee, or hold your knee instead of your toe. Find the variation that works best for you—and your body’s needs.

steps

From Tadasana, press into the big toe mounds, and observe the natural curve of the low back (pelvis is neither spilling forward nor backward) and the evenness on the two sides of the torso.
Firm the left leg, without hyperextending the left knee, then bend the right leg and clasp the big toe with the first two fingers of the right hand.
Press the right foot forward and notice the effect throughout the rest of the body.
Lift the sternum up and restore some of the curve of the lower back.
Find an anterior tilt of the pelvis to deepen the work in the hamstrings.
Notice if the right hip is hiked up higher than the left hip.
Descend the right hip down and in toward the left foot in order to bring symmetry back to the torso; do this without compromising the straightness or neutrality of the left leg.
Hold for anywhere from a few breaths to a couple of minutes.
Take a complete cycle of breath, using the exhale to root down firmly with the left foot.
Hold for anywhere from a few breaths to a couple of minutes, then, use an exhale to recommit to the rootedness of the left foot.
Release and repeat on the other side.
