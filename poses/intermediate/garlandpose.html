Malasana, also know as Garland pose or Yogic Squat, is a yoga asana that I see often in magazines and social media. It seems to fit the “image of a yogi” quite well; the yogi/yogini always seems grounded, comfortable, and peaceful.

The truth is, Malasana is a pose that is accessible to some yogis and yoginis and extremely uncomfortable for others. But with some adjustments and willingness to explore non-traditional approaches to this pose, Malasana can be quite beneficial to many practitioners.

Take a seat on the mat or the ground with your feet slightly wider than your hips.
Then, as shown in the picture, bend your knees into a squat position.
Next, bring your hands together and join your palms in the ‘Namaskar’ position. 
Gently press your elbows toward your inner thighs.
Then, try to bring your hips closer to the ground. 
Maintain a straight spine throughout the exercise. 
Then, slowly come to the original position.
